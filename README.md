Thirty clubs compete in the professional basketball competition known as the National Basketball Association (NBA), which is split into the Eastern and Western conferences. Since its founding in 1946, the NBA has grown to be one of the world's most well-liked and fiercely contested basketball leagues. Teams in the league compete for postseason places based on their win-loss records throughout the regular season, which normally runs from October to April. The NBA Finals, which take place in June, decide who wins the league. Notable players in the league's illustrious history include Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant. The NBA is well-known for its elite athletes, talented players, and large international fan base.

For the given task, the group was assigned to develop a face recognition program that can identify both unknown and known faces. In alignment with the previous activity during the midterms, where the group created a dashboard about LeBron James' NBA Stats, the group will use Google Colab to identify the faces of the players of their choice, as well as their faces when they are with their other teammates.
